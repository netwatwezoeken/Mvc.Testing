# Mvc.Testing
Alternative to [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing) implementation to enable testing using actual endpoints.

This package provides an alternative WebApplicationFactory implementation. Instead using a [TestServer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.testhost.testserver) it spins up Kestrel to expose listen to a port over the network. This allows a browser to access the application in a test scenario. Ideal to use in combination with [Playwirght](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/) for instance.

While the [same is possible using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing](https://danieldonbavand.com/2022/06/13/using-playwright-with-the-webapplicationfactory-to-test-a-blazor-application/). The method leaves you with a duplicate Host and will cause `ConfigureWebHost` to be invoked twice. This project is a copy of [Microsoft's WebApplicationFactory](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/tree/main/src/Mvc/Mvc.Testing/src) but it invokes Kerstel instead of the TestServer. The advantage is that you no longer need to worry about any side effect that might occur when `ConfigureWebHost` is called twice.  

## Usage

1. Add this package in you test project

`dotnet add package Nwwz.Mvc.Testing`
2. Create a custom class that inherits from the `WebApplicationFactory`:
```csharp
internal class CustomWebApplicationFactory : Nwwz.Mvc.Testing.WebApplicationFactory<Program>
{
    protected override void ConfigureWebHost(IWebHostBuilder builder) =>
        builder.ConfigureTestServices(services =>
            {
                // Add testservices here
            });
}
```

3. A simple (xUnit)test like below will start the app, start a browsers and visit the home page
```csharp
public class Testing
{
    [Fact]
    public async Task Test()
    {
        var factory = new CustomWebApplicationFactory();
        var playwright = await Microsoft.Playwright.Playwright.CreateAsync();
        var browser = await playwright.Chromium.LaunchAsync(new BrowserTypeLaunchOptions
        {
            Headless = false
        });
        var page = await browser.NewPageAsync();
        
        await page.GotoAsync(factory.ServerAddress);
    }
}
```
4. Starting the whole app and a browser for each test might be a bit much performance wise. Make sure that the app and browser are only started once  and reused for each test. For example by leveraging [xUnit's ICollectionFixture](https://xunit.net/docs/shared-context#collection-fixture)

## Compatibility

The code is fully compatible with Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing. For example, `CreateClient()` will still return a client that connects to the application under test.

The fact that is expose real endpoints comes with the need for a couple of extensions though.

### Server address
The property `ServerAddress` expose the endpoint as can be seen in the example above.

### Toggle https
Toggle between http and https. The default is https.
To use http set `UseHttps` to false.
```csharp
internal class CustomWebApplicationFactory : Nwwz.Mvc.Testing.WebApplicationFactory<Program>
{
    public CustomWebApplicationFactory()
    {
        // Optionally specify to use https or not, default is true
        UseHttps = false;
    }
    
    protected override void ConfigureWebHost(IWebHostBuilder builder) =>
        builder.ConfigureTestServices(services =>
            {
                // Add testservices here
            });
}
```
